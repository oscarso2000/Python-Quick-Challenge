# Python-Quick-Challenge
Write a program that begins by the user inputting an amount of change. The program should then compute the change and specify which and how many of each denomination of change should be used. Try to optimize the program to use the fewest number of coins as possible. There are pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters and $1 coins.
